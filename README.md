# Pi4-K3s-IoT-Monitoring-System
This repository contains a project for setting up a K3s cluster using Raspberry Pi 4 devices. The cluster includes a deployment of Pods running RabbitMQ, Telegraf, InfluxDB, and an RTSP Receiver. This setup demonstrates the capability of resource-constrained devices to run a fully functional edge computing environment.
